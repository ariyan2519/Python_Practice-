# Python_Practice-

This repository contains my Python practice exercises from the "Code with Harry" channel and the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python."

I’ve already learned a few things, and now I’m continuing my journey in a more organized way. This will include long-term plans focusing on Python, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), LeetCode problem-solving, and other programming concepts.

Stay tuned for more updates as I work through my roadmap step by step!
